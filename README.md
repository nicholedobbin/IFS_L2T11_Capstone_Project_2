This Capstone Project's task was to refactor my L2T07 Capstone Project, which was a Java OOP program that helps a food delivery 
company keep track of orders and distribute them accordingly. 

The descriptions of changes made can be found in the comments at the top of each class (Main, Customer, Restaurant, Driver and Invoice).
